> Mix of random and manually put together world assets, which makes cool maps.

## Template Format:

- X -> Wall
- R -> Deposit
- M -> Gem Pile
- 0123456789 -> Wall with certain likelihood. (1 -> 10%, 9 -> 90%)
- abcdefghij -> Deposit with certain likelihood. (b -> 10%, j -> 90%)
- ABCDEFGHIJ -> Gem Pile with certain likelihood. (B -> 10%, J -> 90%)
- klmnopqrst -> Wall, if not deposit (l -> 10%, t -> 90% )
- KLNOPQSTUV -> Deposit, if not Gem Pile (L -> 10%, V -> 90%)
- uvwxyz!/$% -> Gem Pile, if not wall (v -> 10%, ÃŸ -> 90 % )

Please note that template may be randomly mirrored and rotated before being displayed in-game.

> if you open the template_edit.html file in your browser, theres a simple editor that makes all this pretty intuitive i think
